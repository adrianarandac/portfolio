          Greetings! I’m Adrián Aranda and I'm a full stack web developer from
          Barcelona, Spain. I studied electronics and audiovisual production
          but, due to my dynamic profile, I got in charge of account management
          positions, where I gained a deep understanding of fidelity building
          and customer success. At the same time, being deeply in touch with
          tech departments sparked my interest in coding and, after learning for
          a few months on my own with free online resources and falling in love
          with it, I decided to focus on coding and enrol in Ironhack's Full
          Stack Web Development Bootcamp. Despite the career change, I think I
          carry with me valuable experience related to teamwork, client
          management and setting priorities that can deeply benefit any future
          position. As a person, one of my best skills is being able to see "the
          bigger picture" and understand how the dynamics of a project or a team
          are developing. I consider myself empathetic, highly creative and
          assertive. When it comes to my interests, I'm a self-taught musician
          (I have my own home studio!) and I love playing chess. Also, ever
          since I started coding I love to build projects where I can practice
          my skills as well as learn new ones. Now I'm currently looking for
          tech companies, where I can develop all the knowledge I've gathered
          until now and also keep evolving as a professional. I'm confident I'm
          a strong bet as any company would greatly benefit from a talent that's
          also packed with a good business vision and background. Because of
          this, I would really appreciate the opportunity to discuss my
          application and provide further details of my experience, as well as
          references if you need them! And of course, feel free to check my
          portfolio. Thank you for your time, Adrián Aranda
