              👋 Thanks for passing by! I'm Adrian Aranda, a software engineer based in Barcelona with a background in sound engineering and audiovisual/digital
              media. I'm currently part of Bolt's engineering team.
              <br />
              <br />
              🙇🏻 My colleagues would say I am an social and creative engineer with great skills to see the big picture. I value innovative thinking, clear goals
              and having the chance to get involved in projects, as I am really proactive and enjoy sharing new ideas and solutions.
              <br />
              Due to having a strong audiovisual background I consider I have well-developed UX/UI instincts and I can provide a good POV when product
              designing.
              <br />
              <br />
              🖥️ As a full-stack engineer I can work in both front and back end. I especially like fintech projects and always try to surround myself with more
              experienced people whom I can learn from.
              <br />
              <br />
              ⭐️ Among my biggest passions I can highlight tech, music and chess. (I'm a multi-instrumentalist and I have my own home studio!)
